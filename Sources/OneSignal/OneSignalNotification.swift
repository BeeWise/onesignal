         Do not combine with other targeting parameters. Not compatible with any other targeting parameters.

         NOT RECOMMENDED - Please consider using include_player_ids instead.
         Target using iOS device tokens. Warning: Only works with Production tokens.
         All non-alphanumeric characters must be removed from each token. If a token does not correspond
         to an existing user, a new user will be created.
